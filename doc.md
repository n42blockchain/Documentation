# **N42 Application Interface Documentation**  

This link contains **DApp interfaces within the N42 ecosystem**. Most public blockchains provide **RPC interfaces** for decentralized application developers. However, writing, debugging, ensuring security, and auditing **smart contracts** is a complex and technically demanding process, making it difficult for many applications to fully utilize blockchain technology.  

To **lower the development barrier**, N42 offers **a set of open-source smart contracts for common application scenarios**. Additionally, developers can **directly call high-level, pre-packaged interfaces**, allowing them to focus on **business logic development** and enabling **faster and more efficient blockchain application deployment**.
