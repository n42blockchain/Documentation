# **N42 Blockchain Supply Chain Provenance Interface - Technical Documentation**

## **1. Overview**

The N42 Blockchain provides a robust, decentralized, and verifiable solution for **supply chain provenance** through a set of standardized smart contracts and API interfaces. It enables manufacturers, logistics providers, retailers, and end-users to track the **origin, transformation, and movement of goods** on-chain, ensuring **transparency, authenticity, and trust** across the entire supply network.

By leveraging **decentralized identifiers (DIDs)**, **immutable on-chain records**, **IoT data integration**, and **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP)**, N42 solves key challenges in global supply chains such as **counterfeit risk, data manipulation, and lack of interoperability**.

This documentation describes the architecture, APIs, smart contract models, security design, and best practices for implementing supply chain solutions on the N42 network.

## **2. Core Components**

The N42 supply chain module is composed of the following key components:

- **Decentralized Identity (DID):** Each participant (manufacturer, transporter, warehouse, retailer) is represented by a DID.
- **Asset Tokenization:** Products and batches are tokenized as NFTs or SFTs (Semi-Fungible Tokens) for traceability.
- **Event Log Chain:** Each supply chain event (production, shipping, receipt, inspection) is stored on-chain in a time-sequenced log.
- **Proof of Authenticity:** Verifiable data anchored with Merkle Trees + zk-SNARKs ensures tamper-proof provenance.
- **IoT and Off-chain Oracle Support:** Integration with trusted data sources and hardware sensors.
- **Smart Contract Workflows:** Automate validation, payments, custody changes, and multi-party approvals.

## **5. Smart Contract Model**

### **Core Contracts**
- `SupplyChainRegistry`: Registers participants, DIDs, roles, and permissions.
- `ProductToken`: ERC-721 / ERC-1155 compatible contract representing assets.
- `EventLogger`: Logs supply chain events on-chain with metadata and proof anchors.
- `OwnershipManager`: Handles custody and transfer of tokens across participants.

---

## **6. Security Design**

- **Data Authenticity**: All data entries require digital signatures from verified participants.
- **Tamper-Proof Logs**: Events are anchored via Merkle Trees; zk-SNARKs optionally validate process compliance.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized actors can append to a product's event log.
- **Oracle Integrity**: Oracle feeds (e.g., temperature, location) validated via multisig or TEE.

---

## **7. Integration with IoT and Oracles**

N42 enables integration with external IoT and tracking systems:
- Support for MQTT/WebSocket for real-time tracking
- GPS location, environmental data (temperature, humidity) pushed via `/oracle/submit`
- Trusted oracles sign data packets and provide Merkle paths for on-chain proof

---

## **8. Best Practices**

- **Use IPFS/Arweave** to store large metadata (e.g., inspection certificates, images)
- **Batch log** events during transportation to reduce on-chain costs
- **Tokenize packaging units** (e.g., pallets, containers) for nested asset tracking
- **Integrate zk-rollups** for high-frequency supply chain logs (e.g., per-minute sensor data)

---

## **9. Future Enhancements**

- **AI-powered anomaly detection** for fraudulent activity in event logs
- **Cross-chain provenance** with N42 bridges to EVM, Cosmos, and Substrate networks
- **Verifiable carbon footprint tracking** for sustainable supply chains
- **DID-based zero-trust access** to supply chain data APIs

10. Conclusion
N42 provides a scalable, secure, and interoperable blockchain solution for supply chain provenance. Through a combination of decentralized identities, tamper-proof event logging, tokenized assets, and verifiable data mechanisms, businesses can build transparent and trusted supply chains suitable for modern global commerce.
