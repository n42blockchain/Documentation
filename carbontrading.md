## **2. Core Architecture**  

### **2.1 Key Components**  

- **Decentralized Carbon Credit Management**:  
  - Tokenized carbon credits based on **NRC-20 (fungible) and NRC-721/NRC-1155 (non-fungible) standards**  
  - Verifiable **carbon offsets, emission reduction credits, and renewable energy certificates (RECs)**  

- **Carbon Credit Trading & Settlement**:  
  - Peer-to-peer carbon credit exchange via **automated market makers (AMM)**  
  - Smart contract-based settlement with **zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) for transaction privacy**
