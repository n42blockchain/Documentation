# **N42 Blockchain DID Interface Technical Documentation**

## **1. Overview**

N42 Blockchain provides a robust and flexible **Decentralized Identity (DID)** infrastructure, enabling secure, self-sovereign digital identity management. The N42 DID module conforms to **W3C DID standards**, while integrating **on-chain verification, privacy-preserving ZKPs, cryptographic proofs, cross-domain identity bridging,** and **selective disclosure** features.

This documentation covers the architecture, API endpoints, data formats, security mechanisms, and integration guidance for developers and enterprises building identity solutions on top of N42.

---

## **2. Key Features**

- **Self-sovereign identity**: Users own and control their identity without centralized authorities.
- **W3C-compliant DID structure**: Compatible with global DID specifications.
- **On-chain and off-chain hybrid identity registry**: Efficient and scalable storage design.
- **Zero-knowledge proof support**: Selective disclosure of attributes without revealing raw data.
- **Cross-domain verification**: Support for DID resolution and interoperability between N42 domains.
- **Reputation and credential verification**: Built-in verifiable credentials for social and reputation-based applications.

---

## **3. Architecture**

The N42 DID system is composed of:

- **DID Registry Contract** (on-chain): Stores mappings between DIDs and their associated public keys, service endpoints, and credential metadata.
- **Off-chain Storage**: Optional storage layer using IPFS/Arweave for large, non-critical DID documents.
- **DID Resolver**: Module that resolves DIDs and returns the DID Document with proof.
- **ZK Verifier Engine**: Verifies zero-knowledge proofs for attributes.
- **VC/VP Module**: Handles issuance, storage, and verification of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Verifiable Presentations (VPs).

---

## **4. DID Format**

N42 uses the following format for its DID identifiers:

```
did:n42:<domain-id>:<unique-identifier>
```

**Example:**
```
did:n42:social:0xA1B2C3D4E5F67890
```

Each DID resolves to a **DID Document**, formatted according to W3C specifications:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:n42:social:0xA1B2C3D4E5F67890",
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "did:n42:social:0xA1B2C3D4E5F67890#key-1",
      "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
      "controller": "did:n42:social:0xA1B2C3D4E5F67890",
      "publicKeyHex": "0392ABCDEF..."
    }
  ],
  "authentication": [
    "did:n42:social:0xA1B2C3D4E5F67890#key-1"
  ],
  "service": [
    {
      "id": "did:n42:social:0xA1B2C3D4E5F67890#profile",
      "type": "SocialProfile",
      "serviceEndpoint": "ipfs://QmZk..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## **6. Security Model**

- **DID ownership**: Proven via cryptographic signatures (ECDSA, Ed25519, or others).
- **Credential integrity**: Protected by issuer signatures and optionally by ZKPs.
- **Data privacy**: Selective disclosure enabled via **ZK-SNARKs**, **BBS+ signatures**, and **FHE** (future).
- **Revocation**: Verifiable credentials include revocation registries to invalidate compromised or outdated claims.
- **Domain isolation**: Each DID is scoped to a domain, ensuring domain-specific governance.

---

## **7. Best Practices**

- Use off-chain IPFS/Arweave links to store large DID metadata to minimize gas fees.
- Rotate verification keys periodically for enhanced security.
- Encourage use of Verifiable Credentials with ZK-based selective disclosure in privacy-sensitive applications.
- Maintain timestamped logs of all DID operations for auditability.

---

## **8. Future Roadmap**

- **Cross-chain DID bridging**: Support for DID resolution across Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos.
- **Biometric DID binding**: Optional facial/fingerprint binding to DID for hardware wallets or civil registry integrations.
- **DAO-based identity governance**: Voting-based revocation or re-verification of credentials.
- **FHE-based private identity validation**.

---

## **9. Conclusion**

The **N42 DID Interface** enables **secure, private, and interoperable decentralized identity** management across multiple domains and applications. By integrating industry standards with cutting-edge cryptography, N42 empowers developers and institutions to **build verifiable identity ecosystems** for finance, AI, social, education, and more â€” all while preserving user sovereignty and trustlessness.
