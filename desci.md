# **N42 Blockchain DeSci Interface Technical Documentation**

## **1. Introduction**
Decentralized Science (DeSci) represents a paradigm shift in how scientific knowledge is created, validated, published, and funded. N42 Blockchain provides a robust and composable set of **DeSci interfaces** that empower researchers, institutions, and contributors to collaborate in a **trustless, transparent, and censorship-resistant scientific ecosystem**.

By integrating **decentralized identity (DID), verifiable data provenance, immutable publications, tokenized incentives, and DAO-based governance**, N42 enables a new infrastructure for **open science** to thrive on-chain.

## **5. Security and Privacy Design**

### **5.1 Data Provenance**
- **Merkle Trees** and **zk-SNARKs** validate data traceability.
- On-chain hashes and timestamped entries prove submission order.

### **5.2 Immutable Ledger**
- All publications, peer reviews, and funding records are stored via IPFS hashes and linked to on-chain Merkle roots.

### **5.3 Identity Privacy**
- Researcher identities protected via **DID** + selective disclosure using **ZKP**.
- Optional TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) integration for private datasets.

### **5.4 DAO-Based Dispute Resolution**
- Peer reviews and governance decisions follow a token-based voting mechanism with quorum and reputation scores.

---

## **6. Best Practices**

- Use IPFS or Arweave for large datasets and only store metadata/hash on-chain.
- Leverage NFT wrappers to represent unique datasets or publications.
- Implement milestone-based grant disbursement to reduce risk of fund misuse.
- Utilize multi-sig wallets for research teams and DAO treasuries.
- Regularly submit reputation updates for reviewers and contributors.

---

## **7. Future Extensions**

- **AI-Assisted Peer Review**: Integration with on-chain AI models for automated review suggestions.
- **Interchain Publication Sync**: Sync publications with other networks (e.g., Ethereum, Filecoin).
- **Data DAO Toolkit**: Spin up domain-specific DAOs for collaborative research (e.g., BioDAO, SpaceDAO).
- **Privacy-preserving Collaboration**: Use FHE and MPC for secure multi-party scientific computations.
